	Subversion manages files and directories, and the changes made to them,
	over time. This allows you to recover older versions of your data, or
	examine the history of how your data changed. In this regard, many
	people think of a version control system as a sort of time machine.
  This package contains the subversion server.

Description:  Viewer can be behind Nat router or directly connected to the internet 
 instead of forwarding serveral ports, you only need to forward 1 port. 
 If the PC that runs the Repeater has access to the local DNS server, 
 you can use your local DNS names instead of 10.10.10.12.
 This could be handy when you have a dynamic DHCP server allocating 
 ip adresses for your PC.

Description: =
	It listens to all traffic on an ethernet (or PPP) interface, 
	looking for special "knock" sequences of port-hits. A client 
	makes these port-hits by sending a TCP (or UDP) packet to a 
	port on the server. This port need not be open -- since 
	knockd listens at the link-layer level, it sees all traffic 
	even if it's destined for a closed port. When the server 
	detects a specific sequence of port-hits, it runs a command 
	defined in its configuration file. This can be used to open 
	up holes in a firewall for quick access.	
	This package contains the port-knocking client.

Description: 	sync is a program that allows files to be copied to

	It has many more options than rcp, and uses the rsync
	remote-update protocol to greatly speed up file
	transfers when the destination file already exists.

	The rsync remote-update protocol allows rsync to
	transfer just the differences between two sets of files
	across the network link.

 .
 Take care that you don't include apache at the moment into your image
 please select it only as module because busybox will override
 /usr/sbin/httpd. It'll be solved soon. If you need to include this
 package in the image anyway, remove httpd from busybox
 (Base system --> Configuration --> Networking Utilities --> httpd).
 Also you should take care for the initscripts, apache's httpd isn't
 compatible with the one from busybox, so if you want to use apache
 for running your webif, you'll need to change the parameters in the
 scripts and configure the rest in /etc/httpd.conf.

Title: Open public network gateway daemon
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Type: ipkg
Description: 	NoCatSplash is an Open Public Network Gateway Daemon.
	It performs as a [captive/open/active] portal. When run on a gateway/router 
	on a network, all web requests are redirected until the client either logs 
	in or clicks "I Accept" to an AUP. The gateway daemon then changes the 
	firewall rules on the gateway to pass traffic for that client (based on IP 
	address and MAC address).

Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Type: ipkg
Description: 	BTPD is a bittorrent client consisting of a daemon and client commands, 
	which can be used to read and/or manipulate the daemon state. 
	The daemon is capable of running several torrents simultaneously and only uses one tcp port. 
	It's fairly low on resource usage and should be perfect for file distribution sites. 
	Efficient downloads and ease of use makes this client a good choice for the casual user as well.

	hosts to check. If a host does not respond within a certain time limit and/or retry

Title: Daemon to execute Nagios check commands on remote hosts
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Type: ipkg
Description: 	The NRPE addon is designed to allow you to execute Nagios plugins on
	remote Linux/Unix machines.  The main reason for doing this is to allow
	Nagios to monitor "local" resources (like CPU load, memory usage, etc.)
	on remote machines.  Since these public resources are not usually
	exposed to external machines, an agent like NRPE must be installed on
	the remote Linux/Unix machines.

	local networks (Ethernet, WLAN) that use udp broadcasts to find each other to do so.
	It also works on ppp links, so you can log in from windows boxes (e.g. using pptp) 
	and play LAN-based games together. Currently, you have to care about upcoming or

Description:  JamVM is a new Java Virtual Machine which conforms to the JVM 
 specification version (blue book). In comparison to most other VM's (free 
 and commercial) it is extremely small.However, unlike other small VMs 
 (e.g. KVM) it is designed to support the full specification, and includes 
 support for object finalisation, Soft/Weak/Phantom References, the Java 
 Native Interface (JNI) and the Reflection API.

Description: 	rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, possibly over a
	network. The target directory ends up a copy of the source directory,
	but extra reverse diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that
	target directory, so you can still recover files lost some time ago.
	The idea is to combine the best features of a mirror and an incremental
	backup.

Description: This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided in libc
or otherwise available by default.  Libraries like libxcb rely on pthread
stubs to use pthreads optionally, becoming thread-safe when linked to
libpthread, while avoiding any performance hit when running single-threaded.
libpthread-stubs supports this behavior even on platforms which do not supply
all the necessary pthread stubs.  On platforms which already supply all the
necessary pthread stubs, this package ships only the pkg-config file
pthread-stubs.pc, to allow libraries to unconditionally express a dependency
on pthread-stubs and still obtain correct behavior.

	RRD is the Acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to store and

	not expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by processing the data
	to enforce a certain data density. It can be used either via simple wrapper
	scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that poll network devices and
	put friendly user interface on it.

	This is version 1.0.x with cgilib-0.4, gd1.3 and libpng-1.0.9 linked into
	librrd.so. The library is much smaller compared to the 1.2.x version with
	separate dynamic linked libraries.

Description: 	libdaemon is a lightweight C library that eases the writing of UNIX daemons.
	It consists of the following parts:
	- A wrapper around fork() which does the correct daemonization procedure of a process
	- A wrapper around syslog() for simpler and compatible log output to Syslog or STDERR
	- An API for writing PID files
	- An API for serializing UNIX signals into a pipe for usage with select() or poll()
	- An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected to syslog

	APIs like these are used in most daemon software available. It is not that
	simple to get it done right and code duplication is not a goal.

Title: libConfuse is a configuration file parser library
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Type: ipkg
Description: 	 libConfuse is a configuration file parser library, licensed under the terms of the LGPL, 
	 and written in C. It supports sections and (lists of) values (strings, integers, floats, 
	 booleans or other sections), as well as some other features (such as single/double-quoted
	 strings, environment variable expansion, functions and nested include statements). It makes 
	 it very easy to add configuration file capability to a program using a simple API.
	 
	 The goal of libConfuse is not to be the configuration file parser library with a gazillion 
	 of features. Instead, it aims to be easy to use and quick to integrate with your code. 
	 libConfuse was called libcfg before, but was changed to not confuse with other similar libraries.

FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface. A foreign function interface is the
popular name for the interface that allows code written in one language to call
code written in another language. The libffi library really only provides the
lowest, machine dependent layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.
A layer must exist above libffi that handles type conversions for values passed
between the two languages.

Title: IPv6 addresses calculations
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Type: ipkg
Description:   ipv6calc is a small utility written in programming languate C to manipulate (not only) IPv6 addresses.
  Intentions were convering a given IPv6 address into compressed format, convering a given IPv6 address
  into the same format like shown in /proc/net/if_inet6 and (because it was not difficulty) migrating the
  Perl program ip6_int into. Now only one utiltity is needed to do a lot.
