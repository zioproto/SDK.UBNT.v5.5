Title: USB bootloader for Atmel AVR controllers
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Type: ipkg
Description:   AVRUSBBoot is a bootloader for the Atmel AVR controllers.
  It uses a firmware-only USB driver to transfer binary data
  from the PC to the flash of the controller. Once the AVR
  is flashed with the bootloader, no other ISP programmer is
  needed; then the microcontroller can be reprogrammed over USB.
