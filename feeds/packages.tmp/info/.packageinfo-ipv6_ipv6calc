Description:   ipv6calc is a small utility written in programming languate C to manipulate (not only) IPv6 addresses.
  Intentions were convering a given IPv6 address into compressed format, convering a given IPv6 address
  into the same format like shown in /proc/net/if_inet6 and (because it was not difficulty) migrating the
  Perl program ip6_int into. Now only one utiltity is needed to do a lot.
