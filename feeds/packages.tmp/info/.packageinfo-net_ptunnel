Title: Tunnel TCP connections over ICMP packets
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Type: ipkg
Description: 	ptunnel is an application that allows you to reliably tunnel TCP connections to 
	a remote host using ICMP echo request and reply packets, commonly known as ping 
	requests and replies. It acts as a proxy and can handle sockets and secured 
	identification.
