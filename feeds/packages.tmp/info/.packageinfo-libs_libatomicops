Title: implementations for atomic memory update operations
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Type: ipkg
Description:   Provides implementations for atomic memory update
  operations on a number of architectures. This allows
  direct use of these in reasonably portable code. Unlike
  earlier similar packages, this one explicitly considers
  memory barrier semantics, and allows the construction of
  code that involves minimum overhead across a variety of
  architectures.
