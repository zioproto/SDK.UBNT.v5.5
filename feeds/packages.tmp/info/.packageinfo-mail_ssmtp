Description:  A secure, effective and simple way of getting mail off a system to your 
 mail hub. It contains no suid-binaries or other dangerous things - no 
 mail spool to poke around in, and no daemons running in the background.
 mail is simply forwarded to the configured mailhost. Extremely easy 
 configuration.
