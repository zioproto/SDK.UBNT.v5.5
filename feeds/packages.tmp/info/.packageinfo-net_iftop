Title: display bandwith usage on an interface
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Type: ipkg
Description: 	iftop does for network usage what top(1) does for CPU usage. It 
	listens to network traffic on a named interface and displays a 
	table of current bandwidth usage by pairs of hosts. Handy for 
	answering the question 'why is our ADSL link so slow?'.
