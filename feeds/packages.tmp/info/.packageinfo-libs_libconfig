Title: Configuration File Library
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Type: ipkg
Description: 	Libconfig is a simple library for manipulating structured 
	configuration files. This file format is more compact and more 
	readable than XML. And unlike XML, it is type-aware, so it is not 
	necessary to do string parsing in application code.

	Libconfig is very compact -- just 38K for the stripped C shared 
	library (less than one-fourth the size of the expat XML parser 
	library) and 66K for the stripped C++ shared library. This makes 
	it well-suited for memory-constrained systems like handheld devices.
