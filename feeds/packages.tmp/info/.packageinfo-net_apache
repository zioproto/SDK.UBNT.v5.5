Title: The Apache Web Server
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Type: ipkg
Description:  The Apache Web Server is a powerful and flexible HTTP/1.1 compliant
 web server.  Originally designed as a replacement for the NCSA HTTP
 Server, it has grown to be the most popular web server on the Internet.
 .
 This package contains the Apache web server and utility programs.
 .
 Take care that you don't include apache at the moment into your image
 please select it only as module because busybox will override
 /usr/sbin/httpd. It'll be solved soon. If you need to include this
 package in the image anyway, remove httpd from busybox
 (Base system --> Configuration --> Networking Utilities --> httpd).
 Also you should take care for the initscripts, apache's httpd isn't
 compatible with the one from busybox, so if you want to use apache
 for running your webif, you'll need to change the parameters in the
 scripts and configure the rest in /etc/httpd.conf.
