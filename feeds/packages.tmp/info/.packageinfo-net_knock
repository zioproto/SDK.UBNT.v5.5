Title: Port-knocking client
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Type: ipkg
Description: =
	It listens to all traffic on an ethernet (or PPP) interface, 
	looking for special "knock" sequences of port-hits. A client 
	makes these port-hits by sending a TCP (or UDP) packet to a 
	port on the server. This port need not be open -- since 
	knockd listens at the link-layer level, it sees all traffic 
	even if it's destined for a closed port. When the server 
	detects a specific sequence of port-hits, it runs a command 
	defined in its configuration file. This can be used to open 
	up holes in a firewall for quick access.	
	This package contains the port-knocking client.
