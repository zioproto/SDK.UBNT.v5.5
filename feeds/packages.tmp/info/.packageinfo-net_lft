Title: The alternative traceroute and whois tools for network engineers
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Type: ipkg
Description: 	LFT, short for Layer Four Traceroute, is a sort of 'traceroute' that
	often works much faster (than the commonly-used Van Jacobson method)
	and goes through many configurations of packet-filters (firewalls).
	More importantly, LFT implements numerous other features including AS
	number lookups through several reliable sources, loose source routing,
	netblock name lookups, et al.
